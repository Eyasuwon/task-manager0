A web-based Task Manager app. It allows you to add tasks to a list, and update them. You can add extra information to the tasks, mark them as complete, set the priority level, and add a scheduled date. If you want, you can also delete tasks when you're done with them.
The front end uses React, and was set up using Create React App. 
The Node.js backend uses Express.js and routes requests from the client to the database also hosted on Heroku. Data is fetched, added, updated and deleted using SQL queries.
